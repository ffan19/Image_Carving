# Seam Carving
This project implements image resizing utilizing scene carving. It is achieved through computing cumulative minimum energy over both the vertical and horizontal seam directions and removing vertical and horizontal seams based on the cost of seam removal. The two mp4 files are demos of the functions running on two separate images.
